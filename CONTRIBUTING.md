# Contributor Pledge

Welcome, and thank you for considering a contribution to **OpenTruth**.

This project exists for one reason: to help people stay informed, connected, and empowered in a world overflowing with both truth and manipulation.

By contributing, you agree to uphold our shared values:

- **Center the people**: Build tools that serve the public—not profit, parties, or institutions.
- **Prioritize clarity**: Design for understanding. Avoid jargon, obfuscation, or partisanship.
- **Respect truth, not tribes**: Seek accuracy, not affirmation. We welcome different perspectives, not disinformation.
- **Stay transparent**: Share your methods, sources, motivations, and mistakes.
- **Build bridges, not walls**: This is a space to collaborate, not dominate.

You don’t have to be a coder. We welcome designers, researchers, educators, data nerds, and everyday citizens who want to help.

If you're here to help people better understand the systems shaping their lives, you're in the right place.

Let’s build something worthy of trust.

— *The OpenTruth Core Team*
