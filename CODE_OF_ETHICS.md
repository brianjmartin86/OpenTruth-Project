# Code of Ethics

**OpenTruth** is committed to ethical technology and civic empowerment.

We hold ourselves to these principles:

1. **Serve the public good.**  
   Every tool, protocol, and dataset we create must serve the public—not political actors, corporations, or ideologies.

2. **Protect the vulnerable.**  
   We will not build tools that could be weaponized against individuals, communities, or marginalized groups.

3. **Avoid false neutrality.**  
   While nonpartisan, we stand against disinformation, corruption, and abuses of power—regardless of origin.

4. **Open by default.**  
   We publish our methods, code, and data. When possible, we also publish the reasoning behind our choices.

5. **Interrogate influence.**  
   We will question who benefits, who’s left out, and who holds power in any system we analyze or expose.

6. **Evolve with integrity.**  
   We listen. We admit when we’re wrong. We adapt transparently.

We are not perfect—but we aim to be accountable, honest, and deeply human in all we do.
