# Why Now?

We’re living through an information storm.

On one side: truth, evidence, public service, civic duty.  
On the other: disinformation, manipulation, power-hoarding, and profit from confusion.

Our institutions are struggling to keep up.  
Our media is drowning in noise.  
Our democracy is wobbling on a foundation of uncertainty.

**But what if we had tools to see clearly?**  
What if we treated truth like public infrastructure—something everyone could access, verify, and protect?

**OpenTruth** was born from that question.

Not to fight speech with censorship.  
Not to pick sides in partisan wars.  
But to give people the visibility they need to reconnect—to each other, to facts, and to what matters.

Because when people can see what’s happening and who’s shaping it, they stop fighting shadows.  
They stop being manipulated.  
And they start demanding better.

We’re here to make that kind of clarity possible.  
One protocol. One tool. One act of open-source collaboration at a time.
