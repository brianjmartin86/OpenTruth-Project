# OpenTruth 
**A public framework for civic transparency, truth, and trust.**

In an age overwhelmed by information—some enlightening, some manipulative—we believe that people deserve clarity. 

**OpenTruth** is a nonpartisan, open-source initiative dedicated to restoring public trust by making the forces shaping our world **transparent**, **auditable**, and **accessible to all**.
We’re building tools and protocols that:
- Expose how money and influence move through politics and media
- Make algorithmic decisions more understandable and observable
- Help everyday people navigate facts, distortions, and narratives
- Empower researchers, journalists, and citizens to hold power accountable

```
This is not about left vs. right.
It’s about truth vs. manipulation. 
It’s about transparency over secrecy. 
It’s about giving people the tools to reconnect, not divide.
```

OpenTruth aims to be a **public utility for civic clarity**—free from financial, political, or corporate agendas. Inspired by open-source values, we invite everyone—developers, educators, watchdogs, and curious citizens—to join us in creating a system where **the truth doesn’t hide behind walls**, and **democracy has the light it needs to thrive**.

## Why We're Building This
- Misinformation divides communities and erodes democracy. 
- Platforms profit from confusion; power concentrates in the shadows. 
- But transparency can build bridges. And code can illuminate complexity.

   Aggregate and visualize political ad data from major platforms (Meta, Google, etc.)—exposing funding, targeting patterns, and issue framing.
2. **Amplification Log** 
   Explore how content goes viral, gets buried, or is boosted—revealing the hidden machinery of narrative control.
3. **Civic Influence Map** 
   Connect public officials, corporate funders, media outlets, and platform decisions in an open graph-style dataset.
